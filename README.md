# Adult-database-KNN-model

Extraction was done by Barry Becker from the 1994 Census database. A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1)&& (HRSWK>0)).

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) model for the adult database to predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.
